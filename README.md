# WGU-C867---Class-Roster---C-
Files with examples that meet expectations

--Not for plagiarism--I am not responsible for your failure to be competent at coding--
---------------------------------------------------------
How to use:

If you watch the videos where the instructor is explaining another version of the project
but instead building a repository for books, congratulations, you're watching a good video with
prime examples and explanations for how things should be formatted and work...nerd.


**If you are new to C++ this is important to know (I usually code in JS and C#):

You have to create a header file for your cpp files so that values and functions can be declared.

for example:

roster.h -> roster.cpp
student.h -> student.cpp

-we also have degree.h

it is paired with the student.cpp file because it contains a values that will be in the student object in student.cpp file .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should be creating 6 files in the IDE.

Create a file named: main.cpp 
   (This file will run all of your main functions from the roster.cpp and student.cpp files.)
   - Write an output at the top with your details (name, your student id, the course title, etc)
          cout<< "" <<endl
   -Copy and paste that list of student and their details and modify the last one to fit your details.

---------------------------------------------

Second, create the degree.h, student.h.

In degree.h, create the enumerated values

Then, go to your student.h 

create the Student class.

      create the private values(values that are contained in the student object).

        create the public values(values/functions that interact with everything else in the program).
            -create/name all of you getter(accessors) and setter(mutators).

Done with that?? Great.
------------------------------------------------
Create a file called: student.cpp

  create the constructors(this is so you can create each student for the roster)
  
  Next, create your setters.
  
  Then, create your getters.
  
  Last and certainly not least, create the print();
    -you will definitely need this function for later.

------------------------------------------------------

Create a file called: roster.h

Oh boy, this is where big s#&@ happens.

Create the class roster object.

You only have public values and functions in this one because everything in here is involved.

Open up the roster file and you will see the series of names of things you need to create...easy right? wrong dammit, you've worked hard up into this point,
probably had to debug a bit and still barely know whats going on. "Why did WGU throw us in the deep end?". Look princess, you want to be seem smart, you want to tell
people "yeah I can code a bit", well look here butt munch, it isn't easy coding which is why it pays so damn much. Sweet mother of god, imagine drinking fresh coffee from
the break room and thinking, "I'm better than everyone I know because I make so much money". Remember why you wanted to learn to code in the first place. If it's 
brain frying and difficult, you are doing it right and eventually, (like everybody else who knows how to code) you will be in disbelief how easy the things
you thought were difficult are. Perseverance is the name of the game, you don't have to have an IQ of 120+, been coding since you were 10 (usually some bs story tbh, 
I rememeber tinkering with HTML when I was in middle school and every body thought I was a genius), be asian or from a nordic country or really anything.

You need to have a compiler.

The will to want to do it. 

A mind that will tackle tough shit until you understand it.

AND!!! Look up on the internet if you do not understand a term, it will all come together eventually.

Dont waste your life away watching videos "Learn C++ in an hour", you will waste an hour of your life. You learn code by coding shit.
      -there's the secret and most emphasized point I can ever make.

-------------------------------------------------
Create a file called: roster.cpp

 class roster constructor.

Then create the string Roster:: Get StudentID

Once, done with that you will create the parse method. 
      -This is where you will pull the student information and create a student object for each student
      
      -A delimiter is one or more characters that separate text strings. The delimeter we're using is " , ".

  Create the Roster add function.
  
  Remove function.
  
  And so on and so forth.
  
  If you ended at the destructor, good job.
  
  Destructors clean up the memory so that your programs don't run slow or destroy the piece of technology you are using.

Follow the video, use these files as a clearer example.

Like is said this is not for plagiarism and if you get in trouble for it, fuck you in advanced thats your fault.

My code is pretty clear and obvious and I didn't take much time writing this because my life is busy af.
